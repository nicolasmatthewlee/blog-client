        "type":"paragraph","content":"Cows are known for their impressive digestive system, which is optimized to extract nutrients from tough plant materials such as grasses and hay. They have four stomach compartments – the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum – that work together to break down and digest their food. Their large intestines are also capable of fermenting cellulose, which is important for digesting tough plant fibers."
